        <div>
            <h1>React UI Components</h1>
            <p>Here is my components for prototyping on ReactJS. All of this is inspired by Google Material Design.
                However, I have customized something. Something is redundant for my purposes. So, you can use my components, check the sources
                but please take to account that it's just reference. In real life it would be better to use Redux or Mobx in some cases.
                How to interact with another libs and frameworks, how to handle state changes - it is your decision.
            </p>
            <p>I appreciate any feedback!</p>
